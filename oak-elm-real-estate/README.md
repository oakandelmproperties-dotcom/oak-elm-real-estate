# Oak & Elm Properties — Next.js + Tailwind

Zero-code deploy steps:

1. Create a free Vercel account at https://vercel.com and connect your GitHub (or use “Import Project” and pick this folder).
2. Upload this project as a new GitHub repo (or drag-drop if supported), then click **Deploy**.
3. In your Google Domains, point your domain to Vercel (Vercel gives you the exact DNS records).
4. Edit `app/page.jsx` to replace the Rently iframe placeholder with your real embed, and update the contact form `action` with your Formspree ID or embed a Google Form.
5. Done. Future edits can happen in Vercel’s file editor or by updating the repo.
